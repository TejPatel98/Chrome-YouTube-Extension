# Chrome YouTube Extention 

We named our project __Smart Seek__

Helps the user by finding the keyworkds from the video. And if wanted by the user, you can jumo directly to the part of the video where it is being used. Thus, helping to save time, by skipping the unneccessary parts of the video.

Worked on it During CatHacks Hackathon 2018.
